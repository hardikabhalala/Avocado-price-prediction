# Avocado-price-prediction
In this project evaluate the model for predicting  the price of avocado by using various regression models


steps followed:-
  - Data preprocessing and data cleaning
  - Feature engineering to extract relevent feature
  - Visualization of different patterns and relationship between variables
  - Applied various regression algorithm
  - Train and evaluate the model to get best accuracy
